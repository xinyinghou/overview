Provide a Solution-only Personalized Adaptive Puzzle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This provides a **solution-only personalized adaptive puzzle** based on students' current written code.
The students can interact with the puzzle and try to solve it.

The students can regenerate the puzzle based on their updated code anytime by clicking the "Regenerate Help" button.

:Paired Block Sets: 
    - Pairs a correct block with an incorrect block that is not needed in a correct solution.
    - Try to use students' own wrong code as distractor blocks.

    Finish a function, ``phrase(person, thing)``:
        - It has ``person`` and ``thing`` as input.
        - First verify whether ``person`` and ``thing`` are strings. If not, return ``False``.
        - If ``person`` and ``thing`` are two strings, return one string with the characters in ``person``, followed by an empty space, and then followed by ``thing``
        - Make sure the first letter in ``person`` is capitalized and all the characters in ``thing`` are lowercase.
