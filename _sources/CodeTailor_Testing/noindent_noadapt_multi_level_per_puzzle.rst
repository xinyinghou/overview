Provide a Block-and-Solution Personalized Adaptive Puzzle with a common solution (example solution)-based one as the safeguard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type provides a **block-and-solution personalized adaptive puzzle** based on students' current written code.

The students can interact with the puzzle and try to solve it.

The students can regerenate the puzzle based on their updated code anytime by clicking the "Regerenate Help" button.

:Movable Blocks:
    Move the correct blocks from the left box to the right box and put them into the correct order.

:Static Blocks: 
    - The Static blocks are the blocks that are already in position in the answer box. You can not move them.
    - You can hover over the static blocks to see how many blocks are needed above and below them.

:Paired Block Sets: 
    - Pairs with a correct block and an incorrect block that is not needed in a correct solution.
    - Use students' own wrong code as distractor blocks.
    - The incorrect blocks may contain syntactic or semantic errors.
    - The correct code is randomly shown above or below the incorrect block.

    Finish a function, ``phrase(person, thing)``:
        - It has ``person`` and ``thing`` as input.
        - First verify whether ``person`` and ``thing`` are strings. If not, return ``False``.
        - If ``person`` and ``thing`` are two strings, return one string with the characters in ``person``, followed by an empty space, and then followed by ``thing``
        - Make sure the first letter in ``person`` is capitalized and all the characters in ``thing`` are lowercase.
